// Cabin weekend: Spencer's CABIIN 2.0 board game (raw sheet kept at
// `reference/cabiin-2/`) translated into the one-card format. Teams became
// the drawing player or a home-state call-out, board movement and skipped
// turns became pours, and multi-round effects last until the drawer's next
// turn. Spaces that only work on the board (the legend, zone scaffolding),
// guess-the-roll spaces, spaces that depend on another card, and lore that
// needs its backstory were left out. The CABIIN-born cards that used to sit
// in Core live here now under `cabin.*` IDs; their old `core.*` IDs are
// retired and old saves keep their own snapshot. A few House rows that
// already carried CABIIN spaces are shared by ID, untouched.
